For a professional NuGet package, you should add a package icon:

1. Create a 128x128px PNG image named `icon.png`
2. Place it in the Kippo project folder
3. The Kippo.csproj is already configured to include it

## Design Suggestions for Icon:
- Simple, recognizable logo
- Works well at small sizes
- Transparent background
- Related to Telegram or messaging (e.g., chat bubble, robot, envelope)
- Use your brand colors

## Tools to Create Icon:
- Figma (https://figma.com)
- Canva (https://canva.com)
- GIMP (free)
- Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop

Once you have the icon, simply save it as `icon.png` in this directory.
