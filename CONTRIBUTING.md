## Coding Standards

### C# Style Guide

- Use **PascalCase** for public members, types, and namespaces
- Use **camelCase** for private fields and local variables
- Prefix private fields with underscore: `_privateField`
- Use `var` when the type is obvious
- Use meaningful names that describe purpose
- Add XML documentation for public APIs

### Example

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Handles the /start command.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="context">The update context.</param>
[Command("start")]
public async Task HandleStart(Context context)
{
    var userName = context.Update.Message?.From?.FirstName ?? "User";
    await context.Reply($"Welcome, {userName}!");
}
```

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
- `Add: new feature description`
- `Fix: bug description`
- `Update: what was updated`
- `Remove: what was removed`
- `Refactor: what was refactored`
